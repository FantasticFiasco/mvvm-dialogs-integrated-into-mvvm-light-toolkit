# MVVM Dialogs integrated into MVVM Light Toolkit

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9rwhoaa4wrni5494/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/FantasticFiasco/mvvm-dialogs-with-mvvm-light-toolkit/branch/master)

This repository contains code integrating [MVVM Dialogs](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/mvvm-dialogs) into a sample application built using [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://www.mvvmlight.net/). As it normally is with software development, it is not the only way to accomplish the integration, most certainly not the optimal for you. But it's certainly a start.
